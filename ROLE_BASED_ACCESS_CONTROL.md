# Role-Based Access Control Implementation

## 🎯 **Overview**
Successfully implemented comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) with the Clinic Dashboard as the default view and Quality/Executive dashboards as privileged views requiring elevated permissions.

## 🏗️ **Access Control Architecture**

### **Role Hierarchy & Access Levels**
```
Level 5: Executive        👔  - Full system access
Level 4: Clinic Head      👨‍💼  - Executive Dashboard + Quality Dashboard + Clinic Dashboard
Level 3: Doctor           👨‍⚕️  - Quality Dashboard + Clinic Dashboard
Level 2: Embryologist     🔬  - Clinic Dashboard only
Level 1: Nurse            👩‍⚕️  - Clinic Dashboard only
```

### **Dashboard Access Matrix**
| Role | Clinic Dashboard | Quality Dashboard | Executive Dashboard |
|------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Nurse** | ✅ Full Access | ❌ Access Denied | ❌ Access Denied |
| **Embryologist** | ✅ Full Access | ❌ Access Denied | ❌ Access Denied |
| **Doctor** | ✅ Full Access | ✅ Full Access | ❌ Access Denied |
| **Clinic Head** | ✅ Full Access | ✅ Full Access | ✅ Full Access |
| **Executive** | ✅ Full Access | ✅ Full Access | ✅ Full Access |

## 🔐 **Security Implementation**

### **Multi-Layer Access Control**
1. **Navigation Level**: Privileged tabs hidden based on role
2. **Route Level**: Access validation before rendering components
3. **Component Level**: Graceful access denied screens
4. **Alert Level**: User-friendly notifications for unauthorized access

### **Access Control Functions**
```typescript
const ROLE_ACCESS_LEVELS = {
  [UserRole.Nurse]: 1,
  [UserRole.Embryologist]: 2,
  [UserRole.Doctor]: 3,
  [UserRole.ClinicHead]: 4,
  [UserRole.Executive]: 5
};

const hasPrivilegedAccess = (userRole: UserRole, requiredLevel: number): boolean => {
  return ROLE_ACCESS_LEVELS[userRole] >= requiredLevel;
};
```
