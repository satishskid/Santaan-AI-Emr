# IVF Clinical Workflow Logic Analysis

## üè• **Overview**
The AI-Assisted IVF EMR demonstrates a comprehensive, time-aware clinical workflow that mirrors real-world IVF treatment protocols. The system manages 7 patients at different stages of their treatment cycles, showcasing the complexity and coordination required in fertility clinics.

## üìä **Patient Cohort Analysis**

### Current Patient Status (as of July 22, 2024)

| Patient | Age | Cycle Day | Current Stage | Clinical Status |
|---------|-----|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Sarah Chen** | 34 | Day 1 | Initial Consultation | Fresh start - first appointment today |
| **Emily Rodriguez** | 29 | Day 8 | Ovarian Stimulation | Mid-stimulation monitoring phase |
| **Maria Patel** | 38 | Day 11 | Egg Retrieval | Ready for OPU - mature follicles |
| **Jennifer Thompson** | 32 | Day 14 | Embryo Culture | Post-fertilization - Day 3 assessment |
| **Lisa Kim** | 35 | Day 16 | Embryo Transfer | Blastocyst selection for transfer |
| **Amanda Johnson** | 31 | Day 25 | Pregnancy Test | Beta hCG due - 14 days post-transfer |
| **Rachel Williams** | 33 | Day 38 | Completed | Positive pregnancy (hCG: 156) |

## üîÑ **Workflow Timeline Logic**

### Standard IVF Protocol Progression
```
Day 0:    Initial Consultation & History Review
Day 1-12: Ovarian Stimulation (medication + monitoring)
Day 10:   Egg Retrieval (OPU)
Day 10:   Fertilization (IVF/ICSI)
Day 11:   Post-fertilization check (2PN confirmation)
Day 13:   Day 3 embryo assessment
Day 15:   Day 5 blastocyst grading & transfer
Day 29:   Pregnancy test (beta hCG)
```

### Key Clinical Decision Points

1. **Stimulation Monitoring** (Days 6-10)
   - Follicle size tracking via ultrasound
   - Hormone level monitoring
   - Medication dose adjustments
   - Trigger timing determination

2. **Fertilization Method Selection** (Day 10)
   - Sperm analysis results determine IVF vs ICSI
   - Oocyte maturity assessment
   - Laboratory protocol selection

3. **Embryo Selection** (Days 13-15)
   - Day 3 morphology grading
   - Day 5 blastocyst assessment
   - Transfer vs freeze decisions
   - PGT considerations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Resource Management & Conflict Detection**

### Today's Schedule Conflicts (July 22, 2024)
```
09:00-09:45: Doctor with Sarah Chen (History Review)
09:30-10:00: Doctor with Emily Rodriguez (Follicle Scan) ‚ö†Ô∏è OVERLAP
10:00-11:00: Nurse with Sarah Chen (Onboarding)
10:30-11:15: Nurse with Maria Patel (OPU Prep) ‚ö†Ô∏è OVERLAP
11:00-12:00: Doctor + OT with Maria Patel (Egg Retrieval)
12:00-13:00: Embryologist + Lab with Jennifer (Day 3 Check)
```

**Detected Conflicts:**
- Doctor double-booked: 09:30-09:45 (15-minute overlap)
- Nurse double-booked: 10:30-11:00 (30-minute overlap)

## üß¨ **Clinical Data Integration**

### Real-World Clinical Scenarios

**Maria Patel (38, DOR):**
- Previous cycle cancelled due to poor response
- High-dose stimulation protocol (Menopur 300 IU)
- Final scan: 7 mature follicles (18-17mm range)
- Clinical concern: Age-related egg quality

**Jennifer Thompson (32, Male Factor):**
- Partner's sperm analysis: OAT syndrome
- ICSI performed on 10 mature oocytes
- 80% fertilization rate (8/10 normal 2PN)
- Day 3 assessment pending

**Amanda Johnson (31, PCOS):**
- Single blastocyst transfer (5AA grade)
- 14 days post-transfer
- Beta hCG test due today
- Well-controlled PCOS with good prognosis

## ü§ñ **AI Integration Points**

### Clinical Decision Support
1. **Medication Protocols**: AI suggests dosing based on patient history
2. **Follicle Assessment**: Automated endometrial pattern analysis
3. **Sperm Analysis**: WHO criteria-based recommendations
4. **Embryo Grading**: Gardner system implementation
5. **Psychological Profiling**: Patient persona generation

### Data Flow Connections
- Oocyte count ‚Üí Fertilization planning
- Sperm parameters ‚Üí ICSI recommendation
- Embryo grades ‚Üí Transfer selection
- Previous cycles ‚Üí Protocol optimization

## üìà **Quality Metrics Tracking**

### Current Cycle Outcomes
- **Active Cycles**: 6 patients in treatment
- **Completion Rate**: 1/7 cycles completed (14%)
- **Fertilization Rate**: 80% (Jennifer's cycle)
- **Pregnancy Rate**: 1/1 transfers (100% - early data)

### Resource Utilization
- **Operating Theater**: 1 procedure today (Maria's OPU)
- **Laboratory**: 1 assessment today (Jennifer's Day 3)
- **Staff Allocation**: Doctor (3 tasks), Nurse (2 tasks), Embryologist (1 task)
